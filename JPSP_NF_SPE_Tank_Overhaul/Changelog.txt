v1.0 Initial release of JPSP NF SPE Tank Overhaul
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Focus is on making SPE German tank versus late war soviet tanks in NF playable and feel 'realistic' against eachother
- Hopefully this will become deprecated once the NF devs have time to modernize their vehicles against SPE damage models or make a separate version
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
General
- Early war T-34/76 and KV1s with F32/F34 guns should play similar to SPE M4 Shermans in offensive firepower
- KV-1 with 76mm ZiS-5 should play similar to SPE M4(76) Shermans in offensive firepower
